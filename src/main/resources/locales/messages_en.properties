mySubscriptionPage.textWelcomeToPage=On this page you can see your current subscription and its features, as well as get acquainted with the features of other subscriptions and, if you wish, you can change the subscription by purchasing a new one. Minimum prices are for 1 month access for each subscription type. If, while you have an active subscription, and you change it to another one, the new subscription will take effect immediately after payment and automatically close the previous one. If you wish, you can immediately pay for more than 1 month subscription, then it will be more profitable for you. But carefully choose the type of subscription, because you will not be able to cancel it later only change to new. The higher the level of subscription, the more features in the system you get. Level 2 is more of a subscription to get to know some functionality. I recommend starting at least with Level 3 or 4 in order to be able to not only build a model, but also test it. And you get the greatest number of features, of course, already at level 5, then you can not only test the model, but save a large number of models and tests without deleting, get access to individual advanced settings for building a model, and you can also export data of the model and tests to Excel for a deeper analysis.
